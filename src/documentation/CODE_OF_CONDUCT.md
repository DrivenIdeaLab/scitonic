# CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

## Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a futuristic, harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Here are some behaviors that contribute to creating a positive environment:

- **Be Friendly and Patient**: We understand that everyone has different experiences and backgrounds, so be kind and patient with others.
- **Be Welcoming**: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.
- **Be Considerate**: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.
- **Be Respectful**: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack.
- **Be Creative**: Think outside the box. We're here to solve problems, set trends, and lead the way in the industry. Fresh ideas and innovative thinking are the currencies of our realm.
- **Focus on What's Best for the Community**: We're building this project for the future, so always keep the long-term health of the community in mind.

## Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Conflict Resolution
We believe peer to peer discussions, feedback, and corrections can help build a stronger, safer, and more welcoming community. If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, a friendly nod in their direction is always appreciated.

If you have a dispute with one or more users, we encourage you to first try to resolve it with the people involved. If you are unable to resolve the conflict, and you feel it breaches the Code of Conduct, open an issue or contact one of the project maintainers directly.

## Reporting Issues
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior—or have any other concerns—please report it by contacting the project team at [tonic@tonic-ai.com] All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [tonic@tonic-ai.com] All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
